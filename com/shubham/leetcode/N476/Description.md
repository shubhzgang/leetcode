[476\. Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/)

The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.

-   For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its **complement** is `"010"` which is the integer `2`.

Given an integer `num`, return _its complement_.

**Example 1:**

<blockquote>

<strong>Input:</strong> num = 5

<strong>Output:</strong> 2

<strong>Explanation:</strong> The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
</blockquote>

**Example 2:**

<blockquote>

<strong>Input:</strong> num = 1

<strong>Output:</strong> 0

<strong>Explanation:</strong> The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
</blockquote>

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= num < 2<sup>31</sup>`
